#  Code Challenges

#### By Sharon Njorog

## Description
This project contains three JavaScript challenges designed to strengthen programming skills:

1. **Student Grade Generator** – Prompts the user to enter marks (0–100) and outputs the correct grade (A to E)  
2. **Speed Detector** – Prompts the user to input the speed of a car. It calculates demerit points if the speed exceeds the limit (70 km/h). If points exceed 12, it prints “License suspended”.  
3. **Net Salary Calculator (Kenya 2025)** – Calculates an individual’s net salary including deductions for PAYE, SHIF, NSSF, and Housing Levy. Uses the official 2025 Kenyan tax and deduction rates.

All programs take user input using `prompt()` and display results using the browser console. This helps practice real-time input handling and decision-making in JavaScript.
